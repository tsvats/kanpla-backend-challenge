# Kanpla Backend Challenge

## Introduction

Welcome to the backend challenge! This challenge will give you a taste of working on a production codebase as part of a team. Good luck and happy coding!

### Ready to start?

When you're ready to work on the challenge, clone (and not fork) the repo and implement each task as a separate pull request against your version of the repo. It is important for us to see your way of thinking rather than just the code itself. However, coding is still a crucial part of this challenge.

Prepare the pull requests as if you were contributing to a project you develop with a team. Merge each pull request when you have completed a task.

When you're ready to submit your challenge, share the link to your repo with us. If you prefer to keep it private, we will provide you with some emails to invite to the repo. You are welcome to deploy your challenge online, but it is not a requirement.

We're excited to have you take on this challenge and looking forward to seeing your solution.


## Instructions

### 1. Fix a bug

One of our customers has reported something unusual on their order receipt: The total for a customer order returned `9.100000000000001`. This discrepancy doesn't reflect well on our product, so the team is determined to address it promptly. The order ID in question is `1`.

To resolve this issue, you might have to _explore_ the repository. Happy hunting! 


### 2. Add a feature

We are developing a feature that allows users to see their balance for any given date using the code provided.

Acceptance criteria

-   As a user, I want to see my balance so that I know how much I can spend on Kanpla's platform.
-   As a backend engineer, I want to calculate the balance at any point in time using the order history, so that we can reconcile Kanpla's account.
-   As a reviewer, I want to see the developer's thought process and considerations for long-term solutions.

> ðŸ’¡ _Good to know_
>
> -   You work in a company with a very large product and team (500+ employees).
> -   It is important to make it easy for frontend engineers to consume the balance microservice.
> -   You will likely have to maintain this code in the future.
> -   This code will be in production.
> -   You are free to solve this in any way you wish. However, you don't have to code everything and can also use your pull request to explain a longer-term solution if needed. We will discuss your solution in the next interview round.


## Finished?

Once you have completed your challenge share your repo with us (someone will provide you with emails to invite). If we like what we see, we will discuss your solution in depth in the next stage of the interview.

After the submission, we will schedule a session where you will meet with your hiring manager and one of our engineers. During this session, we will review your code submission and have a discussion about the position. We look forward to seeing your solution and discussing it with you.
